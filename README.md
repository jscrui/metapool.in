# METAPOOL.IN


  ## Explanation

The Metapool Token Contract takes 5% of every tx and when the threshold is reached swap all the acumulated $mpool to $bnb an transfer them to Metapool Contract. 

 Each day at 00:00 UTC, Metapool will enable claims and each user who claims will receive 10% of the total amount accumulated in the metapool. So the first to claim will receive more than the second and the second will receive more than the third. So, whoever claims first, receives more. 

 Attention: To claim you must hold X Metapool tokens and if you were lucky to claim on 1st place, you will not be able to claim on the next day.
