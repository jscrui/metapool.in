##How it works? 

Metapool takes 5% of each token transaction and swap it to BNB. 
This way Metapool will accumulate BNB and then will subtract 10% of the total amount pooled for the next day's Metapool.  Each day at 00:00 UTC, Metapool will enable claims and each user who claims will receive 10% of the total amount accumulated in the Metapool. So the first to claim will receive more than the second and the second will receive more than the third. So, whoever claims first, receives more.  * To claim users must hold X amount of Metapool tokens.  Attention: If the user were lucky to claim on 1st place, will not be able to claim on the next day.
